## Overview
In this module, we used the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. 

##  Resources
We used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and created interactivity for the earthquake data. We added the USGS URL for earthquake data by navigating to the USGS Hazards Program, clicking the Earthquakes link to open the Real-time Data Feeds link and scrolled down to "GeoJSON Summary" Feed. There, we clicked the All Earthquakes link under the “Past 7 Days” heading
      
 
##  Objectives

   •	Create a branch from the master branch on GitHub.
   •	Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch.
   •	Merge a branch with the master branch on GitHub.
   •	Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
   
    
##  Summary

     
     
     1.  Although, the size of the earthquake data based on magnitude looks great, it’s hard to tell the difference between 
              earthquakes within the same area. We come up with the idea to color-code the earthquakes based on magnitude. We, 
              also, added the magnitude and location as a popup for each earthquake in step 3.

    2.  The map has the earthquake data as an overlay on both the Streets and Satellite tile layers,
              so users can turn the data on and off.
